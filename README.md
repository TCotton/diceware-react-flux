# Diceware

User friendly interface to create passphrases using the Diceware method (http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)

Built on React / Flux architecture.

Uses the NodeJS crypto module, which falls back to the crypto browser API in order to achieve consistent randomness when picking a word from the diceware list.
